This is an AI powered, machine learning project sourced from my Python for AI class. Using logistic regression, we evaluate a csv and clean, model, and analyze it.

I had two lovely teammates (Mongolia Lee and Jubal Whitlatch) and together we were able to create, revise, and scrap code an infinite amount of times to create this result.
Our outcome was a little disappointing, but I think that I've done enough linear regression and logistic regression for a lifetime as I just trial-and-errored my way through.

ANY AND ALL CRITICISM AND ADVICE IS WELCOME! All I request is please be nice! I (Olivia Evans) am the sole creator of newmodel's model and my teammates' final report 
(which I accidentally, obliviously missed happening) will be uploaded ASAP.
I don't think I'll upload a link to my video presentation because giving out my name (and my teammates') on the internet is enough exposure for me to be a bit uncomfortable...
I will not disclose my college as well for this reason, but I will say I'm a student of an Oklahoman community college.

Thank you for viewing my repository, and special thanks to my professor Julie Luscomb who forced me to learn all of this
